title: Publishing
---

Once your subgraph has been [deployed to the Subgraph Studio](/studio/deploy-subgraph-studio), you have tested it out, and are ready to put it into production, you can then publish it to the decentralized network.

Publishing a Subgraph to the decentralized network makes it available for [curators](/curating) to begin curating on it, and [indexers](/indexing) to begin indexing it.

For a walkthrough of how to publish a subgraph to the decentralized network, see [this video](https://youtu.be/HfDgC2oNnwo?t=580).

### Networks

The decentralized network currently supports both Rinkeby and Ethereum Mainnet.

### Publishing a subgraph

Subgraphs can be published to the decentralized network directly from the Subgraph Studio dashboard by clicking on the **Publish** button. Once a subgraph is published, it will be available to view in the [Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer/).

- Subgraphs published to Rinkeby can index and query data from either the Rinkeby network or Ethereum Mainnet.

- Subgraphs published to Ethereum Mainnet can only index and query data from Ethereum Mainnet, meaning that you cannot publish subgraphs to the main decentralized network that index and query testnet data.

- When publishing a new version for an existing subgraph the same rules apply as above.

### Publishing with a multisig wallet

There are a couple of ways to publish a subgraph using multisig wallets. Here we'll describe invoking the [`publishNewSubgraph`](https://github.com/graphprotocol/contracts/blob/dev/contracts/discovery/GNS.sol#L231) function
in the [GNS contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaDcA0dd4729c8BA3aCf3E99F3A9f471EF37b6825) using Etherscan.

Before we use that function, we need to generate input arguments for it. Access [this page](https://thegraph.com/studio/multisig) in Subgraph Studio and provide the following:

- Ethereum address of your multisig wallet
- Subgraph that you want to publish
- Version that you want to publish

After clicking on "Get Arguments", we'll generate all the contract arguments for you!

There should be 4 arguments:

- `graphAccount`: which is your multisig account address
- `subgraphDeploymentID`: the hex hash of the deployment ID for that subgraph
- `versionMetadata`: version metadata (label and description) that gets uploaded to IPFS. The hex hash value for that JSON file will be provided.
- `subgraphMetadata`: simlar to version metadata, subgraph metadata (name, image, description, website and source code url) gets uploaded to IPFS, and we provide the hex hash value for that JSON file

With those 4 arguments, you should be able to:

- Visit [our GraphProxy](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaDcA0dd4729c8BA3aCf3E99F3A9f471EF37b6825#writeProxyContract) contract on Etherscan
- Connect to Etherscan using WalletConnect via the WalletConnect Safe app of your multisig
- Call the `publishNewSubgraph` method with the paramaters that were generated by our tool

#### Publishing a new version

To publish a new version of an existing subgraph we first need to generate input arguments for it. Access [this page](https://thegraph.com/studio/multisig) in
Subgraph Studio and provide:

- Ethereum address of your multisig wallet
- Subgraph that you want to publish
- Version that you want to publish
- The ID of the subgraph you want to update in Graph Explorer

After clicking on "Get Arguments" we'll generate all the contract arguments for you!

On the right side of the UI under the `Publish New Version` title, there should be 4 arguments:

- `graphAccount`: which is your Multisig account address
- `subgraphNumber`: is the number of your already published subgraph. It is a part of the subgraph id
  for a published subgraph queried through The Graph Network subgraph.
- `subgraphDeploymentID`: which is the hex hash of the deployment ID for that subgraph
- `versionMetadata`: version metadata (label and description) gets uploaded to IPFS, and we provide
  the hex hash value for that JSON file

Now that we generated all the arguments you are ready to proceed and call the `publishNewVersion` method. In order to do so, you should:

- Visit [the GraphProxy](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaDcA0dd4729c8BA3aCf3E99F3A9f471EF37b6825#writeProxyContract) contract on Etherscan
- Connect to Etherscan using WalletConnect via the WalletConnect Safe app of your Multisig
- Call the `publishNewVersion` method with the paramaters that were generated by our tool

Once the transaction is successful, your subgraph should have a new version of your subgraph in Graph Explorer which means that curators can start signaling on it and indexers can start indexing it.
